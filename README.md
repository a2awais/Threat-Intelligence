# Threat-Intelligence  
Curated IOCs & Threat Indicators
Collection of **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** fetched from trusted, public sources.  

Designed for direct import/use in security environments:  
- SIEMs (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)  
- EDR/XDR (CrowdStrike, Defender, etc.)  
- Threat intel platforms (MISP, OpenCTI, ThreatConnect)  
- Blocklists, hunting rules, or custom feeds

**Important Notes**
- IOCs are **sourced from open, reputable feeds**. Always validate in your environment (false positives possible)
- These are **for detection/hunting/blocking only** 
- Updated periodically based on emerging threats
